## Abstract:
This repository contains the final assignment submissions for the course "Fundamentals of Operational Research" within the Postgraduate Program in Applied Computing at the University of Brasília.

For this assignment, from a set of 14 questions, the group was required to select at least four and develop their responses.

Our group chose the following questions:

- **Question 2:** Implement the graphical solution method for a linear programming problem with two decision variables and m constraints.

- **Question 3:** Develop a function that transforms any linear programming problem (with n decision variables and m constraints) into canonical form (maximizing Z; all constraints in ≤ form; all decision variables ≥ 0).

- **Question 4:** Implement the primal Simplex algorithm for a linear programming problem with n decision variables and m constraints.

- **Question 5:** Implement the Branch and Bound method for a linear programming problem with n decision variables ∈ Z and m constraints.

For the resolution of the above questions, we utilized Python, C#, and HTML programming languages. Please access each question's folder for more details.
