## Abstract:
This repository contains the final assignment submissions for the course "Fundamentals of Operational Research" within the Postgraduate Program in Applied Computing at the University of Brasília.

For this assignment, from a set of 14 questions, the group was required to select at least four and develop their responses.

Our group chose the following questions:

- **Question 2:** Implement the graphical solution method for a linear programming problem with two decision variables and m constraints.
   - Click [here](https://github.com/vitorhmf/operations_research_assignments/tree/main/results/Results%20Graph) to see the results of applying the tool to the cases in this [exercise list](https://github.com/vitorhmf/operations_research_assignments/blob/main/results/Lista.pdf).
   - Click [here](https://heitorvitorppcaquestao2.bsite.net/) to see the front end application. 

- **Question 3:** Develop a function that transforms any linear programming problem (with n decision variables and m constraints) into canonical form (maximizing Z; all constraints in ≤ form; all decision variables ≥ 0).
  - Click [here](https://github.com/vitorhmf/operations_research_assignments/tree/main/results/Results%20Canonical%20%26%20Dual) to see the results of applying the tool to the cases in this [exercise list](https://github.com/vitorhmf/operations_research_assignments/blob/main/results/Lista.pdf). 

- **Question 4:** Implement the primal Simplex algorithm for a linear programming problem with n decision variables and m constraints.
   -  Click [here](https://github.com/vitorhmf/operations_research_assignments/tree/main/question_4_simplex) to view the code.

- **Question 5:** Implement the Branch and Bound method for a linear programming problem with n decision variables ∈ Z and m constraints.
  - Click [here](https://github.com/vitorhmf/operations_research_assignments/tree/main/results/Results%20Branch%20and%20Bound) to see the results of applying the tool to the cases in this [exercise list](https://github.com/vitorhmf/operations_research_assignments/blob/main/results/Lista.pdf).

For the resolution of the above questions, we utilized Python, C#, and HTML programming languages. Please access each question's folder for more details.
